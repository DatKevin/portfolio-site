					<h3>Professional History</h3>
					<p>I was born and raised in San Jose, California and eventually went to attend San Jose State University with a degree in Business Management Information Systems. I was primarily a business student but I figured that in our growing world of tech, having a degree that covers both seemed like a good idea</p>
					<p>As a board game enthusiast, I absolutely love solving puzzles. Every board game presents the player a goal and a number of specific tools to achieve that goal. Just like with coding, it is up to the player to analyze the situation, the available tools, adapt to new challenges, and come up with a strategy to win the game!</p>
