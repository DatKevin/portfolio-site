					<p>After my time in the financial industry, I felt like I wanted to do something more in tech, which led me to my next position at Apple. I was once again a contractor, employed by Apex Systems. We spent 3 months of the 1 year contract focused on training and going over thousands of pages of specifications and learning to use their proprietary software. They had high expectations and standards of what they wanted and my job was to effectively act as QA. Without breaking NDA, I shifted through massive amounts of data validating, cleansing, capturing and updating data sets. 
As with any large project, scope changes over time. As such rules and specifications we would be adhering to would suddenly change and weâ€™d have to adapt and apply the new implementation on current and past datasets. We would also get small side projects too for experimental builds. Those usually consisted of capturing extra data or creating reports and documentations of observations based on the data and reporting back. Those projects would usually have short deadlines and high priority..
I was a diligent and consistent analyst. I was able to pick up and learn the material and offered assistance to others whenever I had the chance. I actually got several awards for having the highest average quality data reports as well as for being overall the most friendly and helpful to the team. 
I had several talks with managers and was set up to be converted to full time at Apple. However, towards the end of the contract, upper management decided to kill the project and everyone would be allowed to work until the end of their contract.
