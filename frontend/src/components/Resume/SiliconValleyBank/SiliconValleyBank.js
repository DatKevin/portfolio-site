				<h2>Extra Details</h2>
				<p>
					My first job was at Silicon Valley Bank as a Enhance Due Diligence(EDD)/Know Your Client(KYC) Analyst. I was hired as a contractor to help with a large backlog of 10,000 reviews for new/existing clients. My days consisted of doing reviews and analysis on incoming bank clients. I would assess their financial records and documents to verify their identity. From there, I would then assign a risk rating and create a 1-2 page report based on EDD/KYC compliance laws and other factors such as location and beneficial owners. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I was a contractor there and we were to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. One review took an average of an hour or longer based on the client being reviewed. We were usually assigned 8 reviews a day with the expectation to finish one an hour. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I learned pretty quickly that the reviews were standardized and had certain expectations of what information was presented, which varied based on the client. Because they were standardized, I realized that I can speed up the process by using a template with interchangeable variables to write consistent yet accurate reports. It took me a couple of weeks but I managed to make an easy to use template review and a workflow that could be used to finish a review within 15 to 20 minutes while meeting the same expectations of a high quality review done within an hour. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I shared my template around and several of my coworkers used it to the same degree of success I had. However, there were some coworkers who refused to use it and had their own ways of doing the review. Management was quite impressed but didnâ€™t feel the need to enforce onto the entire team. I finished my contract as the most efficient worker and we finished the 10,000 review backlog 3 months ahead of schedule.
